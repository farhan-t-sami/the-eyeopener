            You’re already spending so much mental energy just trying to survive; you don’t have much left to put into
            relationships that don’t empower you.
            <br><br>
            It can be tough to figure out when a friendship isn’t the best fit for you—especially when everything is
            ~online~. How can we tell if the <strong>parabola</strong> is draining us or if it’s the friendship’s
            dynamics?
            <br><br>
            Take this quiz and add up your points to see if your friendship is mutually supportive, could be with some
            work or is something you should get far away from (and stay far away from after the <strong>penne
                pasta</strong>).

                A: (-1 point) Even if you do think it's cheesy that the prof called you out, a friend shouldn't make fun
                of
                your accomplishments, no matter how small.<br><br>
                B: (+5 points) Your friend is openly supporting you, without making the moment about themselves or doing
                anything to embarrass you.<br><br>
                C: (+2 points) The friend doesn't tear you down, but doesn't support you either. They probably don't
                think
                it's a big deal.<br><br>

                C: (+5 points) The friend is acknowledging your need for space while making it clear what they need in a

                #3 Explanations:<br>
                A: (+5 points) Even though they ignored you at first, when you hurt someone, they're entitled to take
                time
                to process that pain, which is out of your control. When they were ready, they didn't just unload their
                emotions on you, but instead chose to arrange a time where you could both explain your
                perspectives.<br><br>
                B: (+2 points) They made it clear how they are feeling in a way that they're comfortable with and have
                been
                honest about needing space to process the hurt. However, they didn't give you any opportunity to work as
                a team to solve this problem. <br><br>
                C: (-1 point) Not only did they not tell you how they're feeling, but they’re also trying to publicly
                humiliate you and are seeking outside attention for this situation. <br><br>

                terms
                of "friendship chemistry," which is probably why they picked an activity you don't like, even
                unintentionally.<br><br>
                B: (-1 point) You can think of a million things you'd rather do than hang out with these people and try
                to
                do it as little as possible. If you're already drained before going, you don't like these
                friends.<br><br>

                #5 Explanations:<br>
                A: (-1 point) Part of having a good friendship is recognizing good intentions and being able to accept
                their
                support. If a friend's support is offered as a way of putting you down, or if you feel that you would be
                judged for accepting it, then they probably aren't a good friend.<br><br>
                B: (+2 points) Though you may have tried to preserve their feelings, you wasted their time by pretending
                to
                accept support without recognizing the effort they put in to offer it to you. You may not be compatible
                with
                this friend.<br><br>
                C: (+5 points) You were able to see that their offer comes out of love and respect for you, not as an
                insult
                to your intelligence. Together, you communicate on the best course of action going forward.<br><br>

            -5 to 7 points: This friendship might be cool but probably shouldn’t be your main source of support
            <br><br>
            It seems like you and your friend are misunderstanding each other and it’s having some significant impacts
            on the friendship. Have you considered whether you two have anything in common?
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470381/" target="_blank">This 2016 study</a> shows that “friendship
            chemistry” is a huge factor that impacts the success of friendships. Think carefully about whether you two
            have any shared interests or experiences, and how any major differences could be impacting the way you treat
            each other. For example, the same research paper shows that if friends don’t have a high degree of respect
            for each other’s beliefs—cultural beliefs, moral beliefs, etc.—they tend to have a lower friendship
            chemistry as a result. Part of being a good friend, then, is realizing that even if your friend disagrees
            with you on some things, there should be a mutual respect there that allows each friend to make decisions
            without judgement. If you constantly feel drained at the idea of explaining yourself or your decisions and
            beliefs to your friend, or if you feel judged every time you try to go to them for advice, they might not be
            the person you should lean on. Make a list of traits you would see in a <a
                href="https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=mcnair_scholars" target="_blank">good
                friend</a> and compare it to the way this person makes you feel.
            <br><br>
            While this person may be someone you care about, it probably isn’t the best idea to make them a part of your
            core support system. If realizing this means you’re starting from scratch, the University at Buffalo created
            a community resource about how to build a support network. <a
                href="http://socialwork.buffalo.edu/resources/self-care-starter-kit/additional-self-care-resources/developing-your-support-system.html" target="_blank">The
                article</a> suggests focusing on meeting people with similar interests and experiences, either by
            volunteering or through extracurricular activities. At Ryerson, there are <a
                href="http://www.rsuonline.ca/student-groups" target="_blank">83
                student groups</a> under the Ryerson Students’ Union’s jurisdiction alone, encompassing anything from
            the Ryerson Debate Association to the Improv Club to the Urban Hip Hop Union. You can also <a
                href="https://theeyeopener.com/2020/08/friendship-at-first-like/" target="_blank">meet friends online</a>, through apps
            like Bumble BFF, and on social media platforms like Reddit or Facebook, many of which match you with people
            who share your interests. There’s even a Ryerson-exclusive app for meeting new friends and students in your
            classes called <a href="./RU-friends.html" target="_blank">RU Mine</a>.

            8-16 points: This friendship has potential, but you both have to put in work
            <br><br>
            While this friendship seems good on the surface, there’s something here that isn’t fully clicking—and it’s
            causing at least some of your support needs to be left unmet. Luckily, this is a problem that <a
                href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/relationships-and-communication" target="_blank">open
                communication</a> can help you work through. Someone who communicates effectively should be willing to
            hear out different perspectives, actively listen without making you feel like you’re bothering them and
            always respond to you respectfully, even when they’re hurt. When someone’s needs aren’t being met, it’s
            helpful to have a conversation about what exactly each of you wants out of the friendship. If one of you
            wants to video chat every night while the other needs a significant amount of time alone, it can be helpful
            to lay out those expectations so that one of you isn’t feeling bombarded while the other is feeling ignored.
            <br><br>
            Don’t be afraid to seek out support from other people, as it can be pretty precarious to have one person be
            your <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=mcnair_scholars" target="_blank">sole
                support system</a>. If you feel like this person, while well-meaning, doesn’t understand your goals, try
            reaching out to people from your class or job who might have a better understanding of certain challenges
            you face.
            <br><br>
            This friendship is a mutually-serving support circle (16 points and higher)
            <br><br>
            You seem to have this friendship down to a science, and when things go wrong, you’re likely able to
            communicate effectively because you have a good understanding of each other’s needs. What you need to focus
            on now is maintaining that support system. The <a
                href="http://socialwork.buffalo.edu/resources/self-care-starter-kit/additional-self-care-resources/developing-your-support-system.html" target="_blank">University
                at Buffalo’s School of Social Work community resource</a> page suggests that an effective way to do this
            is by keeping communication open and making the other person feel appreciated as much as you’re able to.
            When you <a
                href="https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=mcnair_scholars" target="_blank">consider
                the qualities that you like about this friendship</a>, be sure they’re being embodied on both sides.
            This can be done through things like celebrating their successes, showing interest in things they like and
            continuing to communicate honestly and respectfully with each other. When upsets do happen, remember to
            handle it as a team, not as two people fighting against each other.
            <br><br>
            On their end, keep looking out for their support. A good friend should be excited to hear when things are
            going well for you but should also be there for you when they aren’t. This is of course within their
            communicated limits; even when they aren’t able to listen to you rant on FaceTime for hours, it’s all about
            the effort. Maybe they just send you a TikTok or meme to let you know they’re thinking about you. As long as
            you can confidently say that the friendship is both give and take, you should look forward to the day you
            get to hug this friend again; they seem great!
