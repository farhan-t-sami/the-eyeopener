But I promise you, there’s tons of nice boobies online that you’re allowed to look at for as long as you want—mine are not them. An accidental glance isn’t the end of the world, but any more than one second of direct eye-to-boob contact per conversation is seriously toeing the line.

                    <b>Don’t touch me without consent!</b>
                    <br> 
                    Here are two things to ask yourself before you initiate physical contact: 1. Did I say you could? 2. Would you do the same thing to a male colleague? If you answered no to either of these, do not proceed. Don’t shake his hand then ask me for a hug. Don’t put your arm around me. Don’t touch the small of my back and physically move me out of your way. Don’t rub my goddamn thigh through my ripped jeans. Why do I even have to say this?

                    I’m fully convinced this is just a code word for “I don’t like women having ideas or making decisions.” Have you ever in your life heard someone call a man bossy?

                    This is another one that you might think is a compliment, and it can sometimes depend on the context. That said, the days when a random male associate tells me I look beautiful directly corresponds to the days I bother to put on makeup—I’ve done the math. If you find yourself muttering “takE a COmpliMenT” under your breath right now, please consider making better compliments. Read: compliments not about my body.

                    I know it’s intended as a compliment but when you really think about it, this is kind of weird. Is my womanhood inherently opposed to my worthiness of respect or is this just your weird way of saying you don’t want to fuck me? Thanks, but no thanks.

                    This applies to all your sexual preferences—I don’t wanna know. I don’t think I need to elaborate more on this one but men, you’re not allowed to feign outrage when you read this. The porn thing has happened to me more than once in a workplace. You and I both know guys who say this type of shit, I promise.

                    I’ve met so many bona fide fortune tellers in my life that it’s not even impressive anymore. I’m going to have kids in seven years and have to decide between being a shitty mother and giving up my career, you say? My maternal instinct is going to slowly and surely thwart my professional ambitions?! Thank you, Mr. Long Island Medium, for that “reality” check.

                    Maybe you’re good enough at pretending to respect women that none of this has really applied to you yet. But that doesn’t matter if you and your homies get together on Xbox Live every night to talk about all the crazy bitches you had to deal with that day. To be honest, I’d rather you say that shit in front of me so I know to avoid you.

                    <b>Do tell your male peers to stop being creeps already</b>
                    <br>
                    It’s not good enough for you to not be a creep. If you’re letting it slide when the men around you are being misogynistic, then you’re being misogynistic. Keep an eye on “your boys” and tell them to STFU the next time they start ranting in the breakroom about #MeToo and how we should only believe women with “evidence.” (Side note: In a court of law, testimony is evidence.)

                    <b>Don’t explain things to me just to prove that you know them</b>
                    <br>
                    Do you seriously think I don’t know that Parasite is about capitalism?

                    <b>Don’t tell me what type of porn you like completely unprompted</b>
                    <br>
                    This applies to all your sexual preferences—I don’t wanna know. I don’t think I need to elaborate more on this one but men, you’re not allowed to feign outrage when you read this. The porn thing has happened to me more than once in a workplace. You and I both know guys who say this type of shit, I promise.

                    <b>Don’t predict the future</b>
                    <br>
                    I’ve met so many bona fide fortune tellers in my life that it’s not even impressive anymore. I’m going to have kids in seven years and have to decide between being a shitty mother and giving up my career, you say? My maternal instinct is going to slowly and surely thwart my professional ambitions?! Thank you, Mr. Long Island Medium, for that “reality” check.

                    <b>Don’t conceal your misogyny until no women are around</b>
                    <br>
                    Maybe you’re good enough at pretending to respect women that none of this has really applied to you yet. But that doesn’t matter if you and your homies get together on Xbox Live every night to talk about all the crazy bitches you had to deal with that day. To be honest, I’d rather you say that shit in front of me so I know to avoid you.

                    <b>Don’t tell women we’re “not like other women”</b>
                    <br>
                    Why do you think this is a compliment? What’s wrong with other women? Is a woman being likable/trustworthy/intelligent some sort of freak anomaly? 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Don’t tell me I’m being emotional</b>
                    <br>
                    Yes, I am emotional. So are you. It’s not a bad thing to be emotional (but if it was, men would definitely be the biggest culprit. A case in point? How mad you felt reading that. Checkmate, meninists).
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Do treat women like people</b>
                    <br>
                    It’s cliche and it’s vague, I know, but this is the best I’ve got for you. I would say treat me like one of your male friends, but I think that’s how I end up learning so much about your porn preferences, so don’t do that. Read some books written by women, watch some movies directed by women and maybe try being friends with some women without the goal of sleeping with them. Hopefully you’ll start to realize that we’re really not so different and gender doesn’t actually exist. anyway.
