                    I won’t lie to you. I teared up multiple times as I binge watched the Netflix adaptation of The Baby-Sitters Club this summer. I began reading The Baby-Sitters Club (BSC) series in fourth grade, and few things have inspired me in that same way since. The BSC gave me a sense of belonging. It helped me build my sense of self-esteem and identity, when I was just starting to figure myself out. And I loved the BSC because I saw myself reflected back in each book (16 of which still sit proudly at the top of my bookshelf) and not just in one character. I could be a creative powerhouse like Claudia, smart and collected like Mary Anne, cool and confident like Stacey or even Kristy, the fearless leader of the group. In seeing myself in all four characters alike, I never felt boxed in.
                    <br><br>
                    <blockquote>
                        “The idea of the girlboss is a mirage. You can be messy, rowdy, emotional; and still be a fucking boss”
                    </blockquote> 
                    <br>
                    Since then, I’ve always believed that there are other ways of being. But it didn’t exactly feel like that whenever I was in a professional environment. There was always an archetype for me to fall into; a way to look and a way to behave, especially when I was one of the only women in the room. There were so many unspoken rules: don’t be too loud (but I am), be overly polite (but what about when they talk over me, say my name wrong?), stay chipper (even when he’s been staring a minute too long). And most of all, take pride in being a working woman—though it’ll have nothing to do with your work.
                    <br><br>
                    As I came into my position as biz and tech editor here at The Eyeopener, I realized how often the struggles and victories of women in STEM are watered down. There is so much more to examine in the trajectory of a woman’s career—her struggles, merits, triumphs and hurdles—than the fact that she beat a man to the job. But that’s what girlboss culture is. I’ve been privy to the unique set of vocabulary working women are subjected to, and how it diminishes their authority. Even while managing this special issue, there were so many instances where I was reminded of the way society has branded the working woman: she uses sparkle emojis and puts the word “She” in front of any pun-junction possible. It’s infantilizing, and I’ve had enough.
                    <br><br>
                    <blockquote>“You won’t find a single sparkle emoji in this issue”</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    You won’t find a single sparkle emoji in this issue. Instead you’ll read about women who are kicking ass in research, education and STEM fields. You’ll also come to understand the way women’s labour is valued in different spaces and how you can better support them. I hope that this issue leaves you with the sense that you’ve learned something about the nuance of gender in the workplace and that you carry it forward so we can one day have a truly level playing field—I know we’re close.
                    <br><br>
                    The International Day of the Girl is this Sunday, Oct. 11. To celebrate, I would like to remind everyone of two things. First, there is no one day to challenge sexism and celebrate women: we should do so every day through our actions, not just our words. Secondly, the idea of the girlboss is a mirage. You can be messy, rowdy, emotional; and still be a fucking boss. And if you want to wear pink and use a pretty notebook, then power to you too, because there is no one way to be a smart girl. No more boxing ourselves in for the comfort of others: the only judge of your ambitions is yourself.
