I’m up eating cereal at unholy hours every night because I can’t sleep. I’m always restless, looking for the next opportunity I can leave responsibility behind and go out longboarding or on a hike with my girlfriend.";

// const p2 = "None of that is actually any different than my life before the pandemic, but at least now I have a good excuse for living the way I do.";

// const p3 = "Some days, I’m surprised people put up with me. Luckily, I’m surrounded by amazing friends, family and coworkers. When I see them working hard, it inspires me to try and put in that same effort—be it for an assignment at school, an article for work or mastering a new skill.";

// const p4 = "However, there comes a point when you have to give yourself a break. I like to think I’m pretty good at it—I’m great at taking it easy, even when I maybe shouldn’t be. You should try it sometime, seriously! You deserve it.";

// const p8 = "When you dive into an article and start reading, you’ll quickly remember that we don’t believe everything is fine. Not one bit. The goal with these stories is catharsis: to engage with our feelings of hopelessness, sadness, frustration, despair and anger; then let them go. Even if it’s just for a moment before they come back, because if we leave them bottled up inside, it’s not good for anyone.";

// const p9 = "In this issue we explore the different ways large institutions are taking advantage of people during the pandemic. We call out racists, sexists and homophobes for continuing to be the pieces of garbage they are. For the feature, we unleash a no-holds-barred assault on Ryerson’s broken promises to its communities.";

// const p10 = "Even though this issue highlights all the ways things aren’t fine, I want you to know that even though that’s the case, you will be fine. We have to believe that if we’re doing our best to be good people, good things will come to us and the world.";
